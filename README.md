## **Weekly Tasks**

### ***Week 01 - Hello World***

This task was to allow me familiarise myself with cmder and VScode. I created a program called helloworld.py. It was a basic code used to print Hello World using python. I used the lecture slides and videos to help me create this code.

### ***Week 02 - Bank***

>Write a program that can do the following:
>1. Prompt the user and read in two money amounts in cents.
>2. Add the two amounts.
>3. Print out the answer in a readable format in euro and have a decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.

User must input two values in cents. To ensure the values are not interpreted as strings, the string input must be converted into an integer. The two inputs are then added together. The important thing here is not forget to convert the final cents amount into euro, in order to get the desired result. A float value will allow the decimal point to be in the answer.

### ***Week 03 - Accounts***

>Write a python program called that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).

User inputs a string of 10 characters long as their account number. and out the account number with only the last 4 digits showing and having the first 6 digits replaced with X's.

### ***Week 04 - Collatz***
> Write a python program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation:
>At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

User inputs any postive integer. It is then determined whether that positive integer is even or odd, with the help of conditional statements *if* and *else*. The *if* statement checks if the positive inetger is even by using modulus operation. If the remainder of the operation is zero, the number is even. Hence, the program preforms the calculations (divide by 2) stated in the *if* statement and prints it out. However, if the remainder of the modulus operation is not zero, the program preforms the calculations (multiply by three and add one) stated in the *else* statment. This set of operations can otherwise be known as [Collatz Sequence Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAp_5qTdOhM)

The *while* loop ensures the step outlined above is repeated for every number until it reaches one. It also allows for list of numbers to be created. In order to make the output list look neater, two steps were carried out. Originally, each value of the output was displayed on a new line. [Print without a New Line](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfact-50-python-end-parameter-in-print/) made the results more compact and easier to read. [Square Bracket Removal](https://python.engineering/python-remove-square-brackets-from-list/) was to remove the sqaure brackets at either side of the list to acieve the desired result.

### ***Week 05 - Weekday***
> Write program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.

In order to manipulate the date and time in this program, a datetime module must be imported. This program does not require any user input. The program first determines the [Current Date](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp) and then from that it determines what day of the week it is. The [Days of the Week](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29384696/how-to-find-current-day-is-weekday-or-weekends-in-python) are stored as numbers, 0 to 6, 0 being Monday and 6 being Sunday.

A simple *if* statement can determine if it is a weekday or weekend. Saturday and Sunday are represented by the numbers 5 and 6. Therefore,any number below 5 is a weekday. 

To ensure this program is running correctly, it should be tested on a weekday and weekend.

User call of the program is :

Output if Weekday :
```
Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday
```
Output if not Weekday:

```
It is the weekend, yay!
```

### ***Week 06 - Squareroot***
>Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

This program required many hours of research. In order to make the program, it was vital to learn how [Newtons Method](https://calcworkshop.com/derivatives/newtons-method/) worked. Once this method was understood, it was just a matter of implementing mathemathical formulas. 

To ensure the input is a postive number, a *while* loop is incorporated into the program. If the number entered was zero or less, an error pops up informing the user they need to try again with a postive value. It is important to remember that the input value must be a float value.

The funtion was created using the key word *sqrt()*. To start this function, an intial guess (which is reasonably close to the true root) is assigned to the variable *x*. The intial guess is equal to the value entered by the user for the first iteration. [Newtons Method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-root-of-a-number-using-newtons-method/) is an iterative process, therefore, a *while* loop is necessary in the function. In order to count the iterations in the *while* loop, the *count* is initially set to zero. The *while* loop checks for one codition of convergance while the *if* statement checks for one other condition of convergance. The value *1e-9* was used in order to get as close as possible to zero. After the *if* statement the root is updated in the variable *x* and the iteration begins again. This process continues until the conditions are no longer true, and the function returns the value of the root. The value is rounded to one decimal place.

           <p>

User call of the program is :

```
python .\squareroot.py
```
User input :
```
Please enter a postive number: 14.5
```
User input for negative value:
```
Please enter a postive number: -5
This is not a positive number
Try again! Any postive number: 14.5
```
Output :

```
 The sqaure root of 14.5 is approx 3.8
```

### ***Week 07 - E's***
>Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line.

Program reads a text file called by the user from an arguement on the command line. In order to call upon the text file, it must be in the same directory as the program.

By importing [sys](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/sys.html), the module provides acess to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. [sys.argv()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-sys-argv-in-python/) is an array for command line arguments in python. The script name is held in *argv[0]*. Therefore, the text filename is held in the second arguement, *argv[1]*.

The [With Open in Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/with-open-in-python-with-statement-syntax-example/) allows you to work with files by opening them. The *open()* function must be used in conjunction with the *close()* function. However, the *with* statement closes the file for you without being told to. There are two parameters in the *open()* function - the filename and the mode. The content of the file is stored in the variable *e*. Using the [Count](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-the-number-of-times-a-letter-appears-in-a-text-file-in-python/) method all the e's in the text file (upper case and lower case) are found and added together.
