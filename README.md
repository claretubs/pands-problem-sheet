## **Week 01 Task**

This task was to allow me familiarise myself with cmder and VScode. I created a program called helloworld.py. It was a basic code used to print Hello World using python. I used the lecture slides and videos to help me create this code.  

## **Week 02 Task**

This program was called bank.py and it needed to do three things:
1. Prompt the user and read in two money amounts in cents.
2. Add the two amounts.
3. Print out the answer in a readable format in euro and have a decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.

I did this by creating two inputs in cents for the user to input from. Then both of these amounts were added together and divided by 100 in order to find the value in euro. I added the euro sign to the print statement so that the output looked somewhat like this: â‚¬X.XX.

## **Week 03 Task**

The program in this task is called accounts.py and the purpose of it is to read a 10 character account number and out the account number with only the last 4 digits showing and having the first 6 digits replaced with X's.
